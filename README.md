# NBA-Project---Programming
Project for the course of Programming and Database - MD Data Science

The aim of the project is to analyze some interesting results in the field of NBA, the National Basketball Association. 
More specifically, the aim is the exploration of two topics, having two datasets each:
* LeBron James Analysis;
* Season 2020/2021 Analysis. 

I will use different datasets in order to reach different goals.
First of all, I will analyze two datasets about LeBron James with the goal of studying his career trends and predict some interesting stats about him, like in how many matches he will overpass the current 'All-time Points Leader', Kareem Abdul Jabbar and other stats he might reach until he will end his career.
The second main goal is to study and find some interesting stats or infos about the 2020/2021 Season using the 'Per Game' and 'Advanced' Stats, for example the difference  in the +/- according to the role and establish a kind of trend marked.

To present the project I will use streamlit, in order to give a precisely way to see and comprehend the work done and the results obtained. 

With streamlit I provide a local web page where I can present my project, according to what I did on it.
In this web page I created five different sections, the first one is about data cleaning and the other four are splitted in two for the LeBron James dataset and two for the Season 2020/21 dataset.
The first one is always containing exploration and basic analysis on the dataset and the second is about the predictive models.
