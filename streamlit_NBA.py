            - LeBron James Analysis: an analysis where I studied his career trends and predicted some record he could break until he will retire, like the current 'All-Time Point Leader';
            - Season 2020/2021 Analysis: an analysis where I studied stats about the season and provided interesting models to reach specific results.

            In this way, I conducted different surveys about the same subject analysing two specific topics. In the same time, I examined the two topics focusing in particular datasets.
            To carry out these analysis, I therefore used two different datasets for each topic. 
            For the LeBron James analysis, I evaluated:
            - LeBron James per Game stats;
            - LeBron James totals stats.
            For the Season 2020/2021 analysis, I evaluated:
            - Season 2020/2021 per Game stats;
            - Season 2020/2021 advanced stats.

            In these datasets, there are the same stats explaining the LeBron James's style of play and these are also the usual stats used to analise different players.
            First of all, the two raws datasets contain 24 rows and 30 coloumns each.
            The rows represent the different seasons he has played through his career and the last 4 shows his career trends and his trends concerning the three different teams he has played for.
            The columns are:
            - Season: every season he has played;
            - Age: player's age on February 1 of every season;
            - Tm: the different teams he has played for;
            - Lg: the league where he played;
            - Pos: which position he played during the different seasons;
            - G, GS: these two variables show how many games he has played and he played starting the match;
            - MP: minutes played per game and totals for every season;
            - FG, FGA, FG%: these variables represent the field goals realized, attempted and the percentage;
            - 3P, 3PA, 3P%: these variables represent the 3-point field goals realized, attempted and the percentage;
            - 2P, 2PA, 2P%: these variables represent the 2-point field goals realized, attempted and the percentage;
            - FT, FTA, FT%: these variables represent the free throws realized, attempted and the percentage;
            - eFG%: This statistic adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal;
            - ORB, DRB, TRB: these variables represent the offensive, defensive and total rebounds made;
            - AST: assists provided to his teammates;
            - STL: balls stolen to his opponents;
            - BLK: shots blocked to his opponents;
            - TOV: balls lost during a possession;
            - PF: personal fouls made;
            - PTS: sum of points realized with every basket.

            All these stats are analysed according to the Per Game and the Totals, so in the first case the playing statistics are normalized per Game. In the second case those statistics are just sumed up in order to find the totals in every season.
